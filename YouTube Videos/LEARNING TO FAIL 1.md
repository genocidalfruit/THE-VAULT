# 💡 The Value of Persistence and Learning

This section explores the profound benefits of perseverance and continuous learning, highlighting the importance of effort.

There is a beauty in the toil it takes to learn a new skill. There is much value in it too. We lose a lot when we take shortcuts, when we let ourselves be led by the dopamine, and over time that habit completely deteriorates our individuality.

Every person is a garden and can grow to flourish and thrive as a garden with exotic flowers and fruits, but if the soil is not right then it is not possible for plants to grow there.

## 💪 Embracing Discomfort

Starting out is difficult because it is hard to be the 'new guy'. It is hard to face the fact there's people who are so much better than you that they're out of your reach. But it is also extremely important to work through this feeling and to persist through the embarassment of being the newbie, because one day, shoveling all that fertilizer and moistening that soil is going to pay off. One day, you will be able to look at yourself and see someone built not out of the flimsy whims of taking the easy way out, but from the intentions of sitting through being the worst in the room.

Do things that make you uncomfortable. Don't make everything about appearances. As easy as it is to succumb to the temptation of quick fixes for everything, learn to be patient and disciplined. Learn to persist through the uncomfortable.
