# 💰 Cash Secured Puts

This section explains the strategy of selling cash-secured put options, detailing how it works and its associated risks and rewards.

==SELLING CALL OPTION==
Selling a put option to make the agreement - If the stock goes lower than value A then I buy the stock at the value A, else I don't buy any stock at all
In any case I get paid a certain price for the option
- Betting on the market not going down below value A - Market goes down -> I make a loss on each share as I am obligated to buy the shares at a higher price
- Profit is still possible if the market price goes down if the cash secured is higher than the loss made on the stock
- "Sell to Open" on brokerage platforms

# 🛡️ Covered Calls

This section outlines the covered call strategy, where you sell call options against shares you already own to generate income.

==SELLING PUT OPTION==
Buy a stock + Sell the call option
- Betting on the market not going above the strike price of the option - Market goes goes above strike price i have to sell my shares at strike price thus making potentially less money
The call option sold is basically some insurance against the stock. There might be potential losses even if there is a gain. In the case of a stock value dropping significantly, the option holder (buyer of option) might not use the option so you are making a loss, but you will make less of a loss because you sold that option.

==Both of these involve selling your option to another party and being obligated to sell/buy your shares to them after a certain period (before option expiration date), at the agreed upon price (strike price)==
