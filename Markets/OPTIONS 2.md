# Cash Secured Puts
==SELLING CALL OPTION==
Selling a put option to make the agreement - If the stock goes lower than value A then I buy the stock at the value A, else I don't buy any stock at all
In any case I get paid a certain price for the option
- Betting on the market not going down below value A - Market goes down -> I make a loss on each share as I am obligated to buy the shares at a higher price
- Profit is still possible if the market price goes down if the cash secured is higher than the loss made on the stock
- "Sell to Open" on brokerage platforms
# Covered Calls
==SELLING PUT OPTION==
Buy a stock + Sell the call option
- Betting on the market not going above the strike price of the option - Market goes goes above strike price i have to sell my shares at strike price thus making potentially less money
There is no way to lose money in a covered call (there might be a lost potential for gain if the stock price shoots above the strike price)

==Both of these involve selling your option to another party and being obligated to sell/buy your shares to them after a certain period (before option expiration date), at the agreed upon price (strike price)==
