# 🧠 Obsidian Vault

Welcome! This repository contains my personal [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault, published for sharing, learning, and collaboration. Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.

## 📂 Vault Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  This vault serves as a digital garden and personal knowledge base. It contains notes, ideas, references, and resources on topics of interest.

- **Structure:**  
  The vault is organized for clarity and ease of navigation, using folders and links to interconnect ideas and resources.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

- `Topic Folders/` — Permanent notes, atomic ideas
- `Rough Notes/` — Quick capture and fleeting notes
- `Tags/` — Labels to link ideas

## 🤖 Auto-Formatting

This vault includes an automated markdown formatting system that:

- ✅ **Processes:** All markdown files in topic folders and main directories
- ❌ **Excludes:** Files in the `Rough Notes/` folder to preserve in-progress thoughts
- 🔄 **Tracks:** File changes and formatting history to avoid unnecessary reprocessing
- ⏰ **Refreshes:** Files every day at 9AM to maintain consistency
